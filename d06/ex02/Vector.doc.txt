<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles a vector in a 3D space.

An instance can be constructed from a 'orig' vertex and a 'dest' one.
new Vector( array( 'orig' => $vtxO, 'dest' => $vtxX ) );

Where $vtx0 and $vtxX are instances of the Vertex class
The default orig is (0, 0, 0)

The class provides not only basic functions such as getters, but also:

float magnitude()
    Returns the length of the vector

Vector normalize()
    Returns the normalized vector

Vector add( Vector $rhs )
    Returns a new vector that represent the sum between the two vectors

Vector sub( Vector $rhs )
    Returns a new vector that represent the difference between the two vectors

Vector opposite()
    Returns the opposite vector

Vector scalarProduct( $k )
    Returns a new Vector scaled by $k

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
    Returns the dot product between the two vectors

float cos( Vector $rhs )
    Returns the cos in radian between the two vectors

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs )
    Returns the cross product between the two vectors (Right handed)

NB: This class is immutable.
